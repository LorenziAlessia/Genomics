"""
Step 0:
I created a folder named "data" in which put all uni* files and the exons16padded one. 
Then, in this directory, I created a different folder for each case (calling them "case1762", exc.) in which I put all the different cases data.


Step1:
I entered in all the five cases folders and ran this command:
"""

fastqc *

"""
Step 2:
In all the five folders I wrote a .sh file called "preprocess.sh" and ran it with the command "sh preprocess.sh".
This is for performing the alignment and checking its quality.
Here the script:
"""

echo "Preprocessing fastq files..."

for filename in *.fq.gz
do
        base=$(basename $filename .fq.gz)

        echo "Aligning sample ${base}..."

        bowtie2 -U ${base}.fq.gz -x ../uni --rg-id "${base}" --rg "SM:${base}" | samtools view -Sb | samtools sort -o ${base}.bam

        echo "Indexing sample ${base}..."

        samtools index ${base}.bam

        echo "Running bamQC on sample ${base}"

        qualimap bamqc -bam ${base}.bam -gff ../exons16Padded_sorted.bed -outdir ${base}
done

echo "Done"

"""
Step 3: 
I performed variant calling in every folder with the following command, changing the case number depending on the folder I was in:
"""

freebayes -f ../universe.fasta -m 20 -C 5 -Q 10 --min-coverage 10 --targets ../exons16Padded_sorted.bed case1762_child.bam case1762_father.bam case1762_mother.bam  > case1762.vcf

"""
Step 4:
In every folder, I ran the following command:
"""

multiqc ./

"""
and selected the variants with two different commands depending on the model of inheritance known:
"""

grep "0/1.*0/1.*1/1" case1651.vcf > reccase1651.vcf  # for recessive case(s)
grep "0/0.*0/0.*0/1" case1762.vcf > domcase1762.vcf  # for dominant case(s)
